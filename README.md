##Prediction Assignment
The HAR (Human Activity Recognition) project has collected data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants in the experiment. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways. We will try to construct a machine learning algorithm to predict the manner in which they did the exercise from the test data.
